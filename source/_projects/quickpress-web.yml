  It was a quite simple website, made with SLIM and SASS (fancy languages that compile into raw HTML and CSS).
  The objective was to make a single-page homepage that displayed some features for Quickpress, along with links to download it.

  It took almost a whole afternoon, since it was one of my first trials with Twitter Bootstrap.
